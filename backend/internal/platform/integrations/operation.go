// Operation is the contract of one kind of outbound work a provider does
// for us (TEC-751, docs/design/integration-jobs.md): sending an SMS, filing
// a KABİS record, issuing an e-invoice. The generic runner stores the job,
// calls Submit, records every call as an integration_attempts row and
// decides what happens next from the Result.
//
// The rule (requirements §8.4): when the outcome of a call is not known —
// a timeout, a dropped connection, a 5xx after the request left — the job
// goes to needs_verification and only CheckStatus may move it on. The runner
// never sends the same work again unless CheckStatus confirmed that the
// provider did not do it. An operation an adapter cannot perform returns
// ErrUnsupported; the job then fails (Submit) or stays in
// needs_verification for a person (CheckStatus). Work that was not done
// never looks successful.
