# Tenant core — design study

Status: **phase 1 implemented** (backend: schema, organizations module, per-request org context, cache) and **phase 4 implemented** (engines with organization scope, isolation guard rails and the RT-A01 test, TEC-673; §8). See §11 for the other phases. Reference implementation: `otopoly-go` (forked from this boilerplate, added organizations on top). This document keeps what worked there, fixes what hurt, and makes it reusable for every app cloned from the boilerplate.

## 1. Goal

Apps built from the boilerplate need a multi-tenant shell (`/t/{slug}`) the same way they already get a platform shell (`/platform`): organizations, memberships, per-organization permissions, organization-scoped data and an admin UI to manage them. A single-scope app (today's CMS shell) must keep working with tenancy switched off.

Out of scope for the core: billing/plans, entitlements, domain seeds, letterhead. These plug in through hooks (§7).

## 2. Lessons from otopoly

| What happened in otopoly | Consequence | Decision here |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant permissions come from **global** roles (`organization_user`, `organization_owner`) unioned across memberships. | An owner of org A carries owner-level `tenant.*` permissions in org B; only routes with `RequireOrgRole("owner")` stop it. Role sync on member removal is a hack. | **Per-organization roles**: permissions resolved from the membership in the current org (§4). |
| Org context lives in the access token (`oid`), set by `POST /v1/auth/organization-context`. | Tab A on `/t/x` silently runs against org y after tab B switches. Every switch rotates single-use refresh tokens, which feeds the parallel-refresh logout bug. The Auth.js cookie grew past nginx buffers (502 on switch). Impersonation, passkey and OAuth sessions lose `oid`, so the client needs a re-switch dance with a ref-held `update()` (infinite-loop fix a13dc92). Refresh must re-validate and quietly drop `oid`. | **Org context per request**: the tenant shell sends `X-Organization: <slug>`; the API checks membership on each request (§5). No `oid`, no switch endpoint, no token rotation on navigation. |
| Tenant login page `/t/{slug}/login`. | Blank-page bugs, two login flows to keep in sync. Removed in TEC-644. | One login (`/login?next=/t/{slug}/…`). |
| Owner sets staff passwords on global accounts. | Cross-tenant account takeover (fixed by `ensureOrgOwnedAccount`, dc250ef). | **Invitations** (email + token); owners never manage another account's credentials (§6). |
| Isolation by convention: every query must filter `organization_id`. | One missed `WHERE` leaks data. | Same convention plus guard rails: repository helper, a lint test over `queries/*.sql`, optional Postgres RLS later (§8). |
| Billing gate (`read_only`) hard-coded inside `RequireOrganization`. | Core and domain mixed. | `AccessPolicy` hook (§7). |

## 3. Data model (migrations 000025+)

```sql
-- 000025_organizations
organizations (
  id BIGSERIAL PK, uuid UUID UNIQUE DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  slug VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,            -- unique among live rows
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  logo_object_key TEXT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active','suspended')),
  access_starts_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  access_ends_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NULL,    -- NULL = no end
  settings JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}', -- app-defined profile/preferences
  created_at, updated_at (trigger), deleted_at
)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... ON organizations (slug) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- 000026_tenant_roles: roles get a scope; tenant roles may be org-specific
ALTER TABLE roles ADD COLUMN scope VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'platform'
  CHECK (scope IN ('platform','tenant'));
ALTER TABLE roles ADD COLUMN organization_id BIGINT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
-- organization_id NULL + scope='tenant' = template role available to every org
-- (seeded: owner, admin, member). Org-specific custom roles come later.

-- 000027_organization_members
organization_members (
  id BIGSERIAL PK,
  organization_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES roles(id),   -- must be scope='tenant'
  created_at, updated_at,
  UNIQUE (organization_id, user_id)
)

-- 000028_organization_invitations
organization_invitations (
  id, uuid, organization_id FK, email CITEXT, role_id FK,
  token_hash TEXT NOT NULL, expires_at, accepted_at NULL, revoked_at NULL,
  invited_by BIGINT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, created_at
)

-- 000029_org_scoped_engines
ALTER TABLE export_jobs, import_jobs, bulk_jobs, activity_events, notifications
  ADD COLUMN organization_id BIGINT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL;
-- + indexes (organization_id, created_at DESC)

-- 000030_seed_tenant_rbac
-- platform.organizations.read/write (super_admin)
-- tenant.settings.read/write, tenant.members.read/write, tenant.roles.read/write
-- template roles owner (all tenant.*), admin (all but tenant.roles.write), member (read)
```

Boilerplate leftovers were wired or deleted in phase 4 (TEC-673): `events.Event.OrganizationID` (`WithOrganization`, carried through the outbox envelope) replaces `TenantID` and reaches `EnqueueInput.OrganizationID` (`TenantID/WorkspaceID` removed); `storage.OrganizationLogoObjectKey` replaces the tenant / workspace / widget logo keys; `middleware.RequireTenant`, the `workspace:` / `conversation:` / `tenant:` channel helpers and the `*.workspace_*` event names are gone. `apiquery.TenantsSort` (platform organizations list) keeps its name for now.

## 4. Permissions

- Platform permissions stay global (`user_roles` → `platform.*`). Nothing changes for `/platform`.
- Tenant permissions come only from the membership in the **current** organization. A user who is owner in A and member in B has owner rights in A and member rights in B.
- A member may hold several roles (`organization_member_roles`, migration 000041): permissions are the union. `organization_members.role_id` is kept as the primary (display) role, always one of the member's roles. Organizations add their own roles (`/v1/tenant/roles`); template roles are read-only.
- Branch scope: `organization_members.branch_scope` = `all` | `selected` (`organization_member_branches`). `orgctx.Scope.BranchIDs` (nil = all) is enforced by branch-bound usecases through `orgctx.BranchScope` / `CheckBranch` (404) / `RequireAllBranches` (403), by tenant search (`branch_ids` filter) and by worker jobs (`orgctx.WithJobScope` re-resolves the requester). See `.agents/skills/add-tenant-resource` §3.
- `super_admin` gets no tenant bypass: tenant access needs a membership (or impersonating a member). Platform admins manage organizations through `/v1/platform/organizations`.
- Slug convention: `tenant.<resource>.<action>`. Same triad rule as today (migration + `internal/platform/rbac` + `frontend/src/config/permissions.ts`).
- `/v1/auth/me` returns `organizations[]: {uuid, slug, name, logo_url, status, access_ends_at, role: {key, name}, permissions: string[]}`; the frontend `usePermission()` reads the current org's list inside the tenant shell. Permissions are **not** put in the JWT (cookie size).

## 5. Request flow

```
Browser (/t/acme/...)            BFF (/api/v1/*)                 Go API
  tenantRequest()  ── X-Organization: acme ──▶ forwards header ──▶ authn (JWT, no oid)
                                                                   RequireOrganization
                                                                     • resolve slug → org (cache)
                                                                     • membership(user, org) (cache)
                                                                     • status/access window
                                                                     • AccessPolicy hooks
                                                                     • orgctx.Scope{ID, UUID, Slug, Role, Permissions}
                                                                   RequireTenantPermission("tenant.x.read")
                                                                   handler → usecase(scope.ID) → sqlc (WHERE organization_id=$n)
```

- Header name `X-Organization`, value = slug (readable in logs; uuid also accepted).
- Missing header on `/v1/tenant/*` → `400 ORGANIZATION_REQUIRED`; not a member → `403 NO_TENANT_MEMBERSHIP`; suspended → `403 ORGANIZATION_SUSPENDED`; outside the access window → `403 ORGANIZATION_ACCESS_EXPIRED`.
- Cache: Redis key `org:{slug}` and `orgmember:{orgID}:{userID}` (60 s TTL) plus a per-org version counter bumped on suspend / extend / member change / role change, so revocation is effectively immediate.
- The BFF allow-list forwards `X-Organization` only on `/api/v1/tenant/*` paths; realtime channel tokens for `org:{uuid}` channels check membership the same way.

## 6. Membership flows

- **Create organization**: platform admin (`POST /v1/platform/organizations`) or self-serve (`POST /v1/auth/organizations`, gated by a config flag + registration setting). Creator becomes `owner`. Slug allocated from the name with a reserved list.
- **Invite**: `POST /v1/tenant/invitations {email, role}` → email with `/invite/{token}`. Accepting signs in (or registers through the normal flows) and creates the membership. Expiry 7 days, single use, revocable.
- **Change role / remove member**: row lock on the org, "last owner" guard (`409 LAST_ORGANIZATION_OWNER`), cache version bump.
- **Leave organization**: a member can leave unless they are the last owner.
- **Account deletion** (already exists): memberships are removed; organizations where the user was the last owner are flagged for platform follow-up.

## 7. Extension points (keep the core domain-free)

```go
type OrganizationHooks interface {
    OnCreated(ctx context.Context, tx pgx.Tx, org Organization, owner User) error // seeds, trials
    OnDeleted(ctx context.Context, org Organization) error
}
type AccessPolicy interface { // e.g. billing read-only
    Check(ctx context.Context, scope orgctx.Scope, r *http.Request) error
}
```

Registered in `internal/httpserver/server.go`; the core ships with none.

## 8. Isolation guard rails

1. Every tenant table has `organization_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` and an index starting with it; child tables use composite FKs `(organization_id, parent_id)`, so even a buggy write cannot point at another organization's row.
2. Repositories take `orgID int64` explicitly (never read it from context inside SQL helpers); body / query / bulk-param uuids are resolved with it (unknown = `not_found` validation, another organization's uuid in the path = 404).
3. Query guard (`internal/database/queries_test.go`, CI): every sqlc query on a table in `queries/tenant_tables.txt` references `organization_id` (`alias.organization_id` for aliased references); queries on mixed platform/organization tables (`queries/mixed_scope_tables.txt`: jobs, activity, notifications, invitations, roles) name their scope or are listed with a reason in `queries/isolation_exempt.txt`; hand-written SQL literals in Go are scanned the same way.
4. IO / bulk / activity / notification engines stamp `organization_id` from `orgctx`; workers re-scope from the job row (`orgctx.WithJobScope`); job lookups match the caller's scope (`orgctx.SameEngineScope`). Platform lists over these tables (jobs, activity feed and export, notification log) show platform rows only.
5. Object keys of an organization live under `organizations/{org_uuid}/` (product images, vehicle documents, export files, import sources, logo); streaming endpoints check `storage.OrganizationOwnsKey`.
6. Search: tenant documents carry `organization_id` (+ `branch_ids`), ids are `TenantDocumentID(org, uuid)`, `/v1/tenant/search` always filters by the organization; tenant specs never appear in `/v1/search`.
7. Realtime: tenant resources publish on `org:{org_uuid}:resource:{name}`; subscription tokens only for members whose tenant role has the read permission.
8. RT-A01 (`internal/httpserver/isolation_test.go`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL`): the real router with two seeded organizations; every `/v1/tenant` route is enumerated (route literals, checked against the mux and `openapi.yaml`) and must answer 403 for a foreign `X-Organization`, 404 for the other organization's uuids, leak none of its identifiers (GET scans, export files, body references), and leave its records unchanged. An uncovered route fails the test. The checklist for new modules is in `.agents/skills/add-tenant-resource` §8.
9. Optional later: Postgres RLS with `SET LOCAL app.organization_id` per transaction.

## 9. Frontend

- Route group `app/(tenant)/t/[slug]/` with `TenantProvider` (public org by slug) → `TenantRouteGuard` (membership/expiry cards, optimistic render from the cached user) → `AppLayout variant="tenant"`.
- `tenantRequest()` API helper adds `X-Organization` from the route slug; no session switching, so tabs on different orgs are independent.
- `tenantNav(slug)` catalog in `config/nav.ts`; `Tenant*` permission keys; `routes.tenant.*` builders; `/login?next=/t/{slug}` only.
- Org switcher in the header lists `me.organizations`; `/onboarding/organization` for signed-in users without one (when self-serve is on).
- Platform UI: organizations list/detail (status, access window, members, invitations, activity).
- Shell choice after login: `next` wins; otherwise platform users → `/platform`, users with one org → `/t/{slug}`, several → org picker (`/organizations`), none → `/no-access` (onboarding later). The CMS shell was removed (TEC-668).

## 10. Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TENANCY_ENABLED` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANCY_ENABLED` | `false` | Mounts tenant routes and the `/t` shell. Off = today's behaviour. |
| `TENANCY_SELF_SERVE` | `false` | Allow `POST /v1/auth/organizations` (still needs registration on). |
| `TENANCY_INVITE_TTL` | `168h` | Invitation lifetime. |

## 11. Delivery plan

| Phase | Scope | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Schema + core | Migrations 000025–000030, sqlc, `orgctx`, `RequireOrganization` + `RequireTenantPermission`, cache, response codes, `/me` organizations, platform org CRUD + members, OpenAPI | Go tests cover membership, per-org permissions, suspension, access window, last-owner guard, cache invalidation |
| 2. Frontend shell | `(tenant)` group, provider/guard, `tenantRequest`, nav, switcher, permissions per org, login routing, platform organizations UI | `/t/{slug}` works in two tabs on two orgs at once |
| 3. Invitations + settings | Invitation flow + email template, tenant settings (name, logo, `settings` JSON), members page | Invite → accept → role change → remove, end to end |
| 4. Engines | IO / bulk / activity / notifications org stamping, realtime org channels, query lint test, RT-A01 cross-organization test | **Done (TEC-673).** A tenant export only contains its org's rows; query guard and RT-A01 in `go test ./...` |
| 5. Docs + skill | Rewrite the AGENTS.md "no tenants" rule, ARCHITECTURE.md, auth.md, new skill `add-tenant-resource` | A new tenant resource can be added by following the skill |

Each phase is one PR (auto-merge after CI) behind `TENANCY_ENABLED`, so `main` stays shippable throughout.

## 12. Open questions

1. Org-specific custom roles in v1, or only the three templates? (Proposal: templates only; the schema already allows custom roles.)
2. ~~Should the CMS shell stay as the "no organization" home?~~ Decided: dropped; users without an organization see `/no-access`.
3. Domain-based tenants (`acme.example.com`) — not in v1; `X-Organization` can be derived from the host later without API changes.
